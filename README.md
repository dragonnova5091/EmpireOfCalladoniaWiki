# EmpireOfCalladoniaWiki

Here is a self contained wiki for my world fo Serberistan. 

To view or edit, simply clone the repository
> git clone <url>
if you wish to make changes, then checkout a branch
> git checkout -b <branch_name>
     dont use -b if you are checking out a previous branch
then make your changes by running the wiki.
> run ./DokuWikiStick/run.cmd
this will open the wiki and you cna edit from there

when you are done you will push your changes to your branch
> git add .
> git commit -m "a message of what you changed"
> git push
    you may need to set up authentication to psuh changes to the repo
