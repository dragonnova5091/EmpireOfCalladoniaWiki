Fruits have been used to create wine and ciders for millennium. In the current era, we have learned that yeasts are what causes fruits to be turned into wine, and subsequently vinegar. However, the porous nature of pottery caused yeast to build up in the walls of the pots, leading to special pots that were better at fermentation.
