====== Surniam ======

Surniam is the southernmost city in the Lapland region. The city boasts a meager few points of interest. The primary being the Grand Jax Mines, The Jalandalus Peninsula, and its various academies and training centers.
The city has an old style of architecture. Most of the houses are built from stone with wooden or thatch roofing. Some of the bigger structures are made with wooden siding, as trees are expensive and dangerous  to import from further up the mountains. The city itself is built along the top of the cliffs of the fjord. To which the cliffs had been fortified many years ago. A mid height fence has been put up along the cliff to prevent accidental falls. 
The climate of Surniam is generally wet. While it does get cold in the winter, the sea air keeps snow from sticking around. The city has developed a complicated system of gutters to flush rainwater from the streets to the ocean. Due to the cold and omnipresent rain, sealskin is used in most clothes for its warmth and water resistance. 
The Saniam are generally kind, although they can be wary of outsiders. Despite the generally wary attitudes, Surniam is an enjoyable place to live as an expat. In the third age, Surniam was home to the largest gemstone mines in Serberistan. Due to a high amount of trade exports, Surniam quickly grew to the wealthiest city in Serberistan. However, the mines have dried up, and many houses remain empty. This extra space allowed Saniam to take control of the infrastructure that was in place and increase the standard of living to far above what many of the other cities can enjoy. Despite having very few draws, Surniam continues to grow in population over the years. 
The nobility of Surniam is generally well liked by the population, Count Marcus Aronteous has ruled the city for the last 45 years. He is well liked and handles most judicial issues himself. The people see him as a kind and just ruler. However, he is growing quite old, and his son, Commodus, is eyeing the title. While Count Marcus has ruled Surniam without the interference of outside factions, as he ages the factions are looking to gain influence over another city. Commodus has been rumored to have ties to the Suomalainen and Mechanicus. If Marcus were to die, then  it is likely that, with the support of the Suomalainen and Mechanicus, Commodus would come to rule Surniam. 

===== Notable Buildings: =====

**The Combat Ring:**
 This is a training ground for many martial combatants. Many older soldiers and mercenaries settle down here to pass on their skills to the next generation. Fighters, Barbarians, Paladins, Rangers, and Rogues can use this as a place of origin. 
The Master Swordsman leads the Ring is named Lucius Normand.
Side Quest: Escort a shipment of weapons from Atlatipoca to the Combat Ring.

**The Inverted Tower:** This tower has been built into the ground as opposed to rising up into the air. The many layers of the tower allow for students to practice spells without risk of the spells getting out of control and hurting civilians. Many of the mages here could not have made their way to Alfheim, but still seek to improve their craft and teach the younger generations. Rogues, Warlocks, Bards, Sorcerers, and Wizards can use this as a place of origin.
The Master Wizard is named Branamir Barcillius.
Front room is a small library of spellbooks, librarian’s name is Aulus Temperestus. 
Side Quest: Retrieve a spell book from Iliamna’s town wizard. Reward: A spell scroll of level 3 or lower of their choice, or 50 gold.

**Temple of the Tundaren:** This temple is a nondenominational temple dedicated to the power and beauty of the Tundaren mountains. The Sansuvut nomads who pass through the city for trade often stop here to pray at their monolith. The priests, druids, and monks who live here seek to pass their teachings on to anyone who will listen. Many Saniam have adopted traditions and beliefs from multiple leaders from the Tundaren Temple, and as such Surniam is very open and accepting of beliefs. Clerics, Druids, Monks, Paladins, and Rangers can use this as a place of origin. 
The Temple is a Unitarian Place of Worship. Any sect can set up a time and idol to worship. All find the halls a place to study religion and worship freely and safely. The head priest’s name is Oren Austiliss.
Side Quest: Pick some alpine sage for the incense in the temple.

**The Grand Jax Mines:** The mines are ancient, having been used for nearly a millennium delving deeper and deeper into the mountains. Throughout the centuries, branches of the mines have collapsed and new ones have been mined to fuel the gemstone trade. As the years pass, the mines are becoming less and less profitable, and Jax is having trouble keeping the mine open. In the third age, the GJM switched to using automatons instead of Sanir to do the labor, but as the years have passed the automatons have slowly malfunctioned or gotten crushed under falling rock. Without a way to fix them, Jax has been considering hiring Sanir from Surniam to pad his workforce.
The gemstones from the mines are sold to the Capitol, Paterdoma, and Atlatipoca for jewelry.

**Longship Longhouse:** Many years ago, someone lifted a longship from the oceans below and turned it into a longhouse at the tip of the peninsula. The longhouse is about 150’ long and serves about 100 people at a time. It is used for feasts and festivals, as well as day to day restaurant service and a bar. Young lovers use it often as a date destination, and businessmen often hold meetings at its tables. 
The hull of the boat has provided a waterproof ceiling for decades and allowed the Longship Longhouse to stay the primary meeting place in Surniam for centuries. 

**Archeologists’ Outpost:** The AoS have a station out in Surniam as a recruiting point for up and coming adventurers. 
The old Saniam Jeremy Tolfish is the head recruiter here. A rather eccentric old man, he is quite adept at his job. He is supported by Aliana Tolfish, his daughter. She focuses on tasks that require her to be more mobile than old Jeremy. 
The building is rather barebones, with a simple sign out front. Inside is a quaint waiting room, and a front desk for which Jeremy sits at. On the walls are a few historical pieces from the Third Age. The pieces are two dragonslayer spears, used to kill The Scourge of the Southern Sea. 
Side Quest: A dungeon rumor has sprung up from Iliamna, go and coordinate with the Archeologists there and go loot it.

**Sons of the Storm Outpost:** Located just outside the Inverted Tower, the Outpost picks up a large quantity of new mages to advance their training past The Tower. 
The building is made of stone with stained glass windows depicting powerful mages slaying powerful monsters. Inside the building is a library of powerful spells, and recipes for magical artifacts. None of which can be made due to the forges being lost, and dragon blood being an unobtainable material.
Joolanain, an Elf Ilsanir  currently runs the outpost, he is a competent bard and is quite adept at hiring new mercs. 
Side Quest: Help the Inquisition track the Sansuvut as they travel north.

Sons of the Sword Outpost: This outpost is located directly next to The Combat Ring. A rough building, made entirely out of stone, even the roof. The walls are decorated with weapons, both inside and out. The only difference being the weapons inside, are not bolted to the wall. The Outpost serves as a spot to boost the career of aspiring mercs, allowing them to take jobs that are not too far above their skillset. 
Side Quest: Escort and protect the Sansuvut caravan as they travel north to Iliamna

Count’s Mansion: This building is a large four story stone keep. On the bottom floor, there are four entrances to the keep. 
In the front is a public library. The library is not beholden to the Count, it has existed long before the current Count and will continue to exist long afterwards. There is only one door from the Library into the rest of the mansion, and it is guarded while the Library is open. Inside the Library are books donated from families across the years. The staff are mainly volunteers, with only the scant few guards being paid by the city. 
On the right(East) side is the guard barracks. Here is a set of rooms containing an armory, a locker room, an evidence locker, and a few offices for higher ranking officials. Guards typically hang out here while on break, and play games like soccer, hackysack, dice, and cards. If the PCs wish to report a crime, this is the spot to do so.
On the left (West) side of the Keep is the kitchen. Here a team of chefs work to supply the Count’s family and servants with food. There is a door on the street level near the railing where the kitchen dumps their trash over the railing. There is usually someone here to chat with the PCs while on break. The kitchen is always hiring new workers, and a PC could attempt to get hired as a dishwasher or chef.
Side Quests: The guards need bait to catch a pickpocket. The chefs are running low on spices and need someone to go fetch spices from another city. 

The Mechanicus Outpost: The Mechanicus set up shop in Surniam a few days after the PCs start adventuring. The building is small, with a large tank of Bor that is used to power the few contraptions within. 
Side Quest: Send the PCs off to collect more Bor from Paterdoma

Surniam Quests: 
The End of Marcus
One of the PCs has been tipped off that a rare and very potent poison has been shipped to Surnaim to an unknown buyer. 
Commodus seeks to kill his father and take the countship. He knows that his father seeks to appoint someone else to the countship.
The Suomalainen and Mechanicus Liberatus are supporting Commodus financially with the poison and with support in the coming succession debacle.
Surniam law states that a child cannot inherit status or wealth from a parent if they murdered said parent.
The Suomalainen and Mechanicus will gain 4 faction points each if Commodus is elected.
========= Clues to this plot
When the PCs return to Surniam, a man is executed with a gag over his mouth. He is beheaded in the town square for stealing from Commodus. After his execution, he is tossed over the cliff to the sea below. He is Antonio Cereluis, a blackmarket fence, and the one who picked up the poison from the seller, and delivered it to Commodus. Speak with dead could get Antonio to confess that Commodus had him killed to cover his tracks.
In the pawn shop of Antonio Cerelus, The Seagull’s Nest, a ledger exists in which Antonio recorded every transaction he made and how much each was. Each transaction was listed under a pseudonym for the seller. He listed many pickup spots, where he would pick up items from the unknown sellers. 
Antonio’s wife Marcellia will give the Investigators of Antonio’s death the Ledger.
The ledger contains a transaction from an unknown seller who goes by Dragon’s Feather, and was fenced to Count the Sun. (The hunt for Dragon’s Feather is in Hideout of a Master Thief)
The Night after Antonio is executed, the Count dies. The cause of death is not released to the public

If Commodus keeps his image clean, he will be appointed to the Count of Surniam. 
The PCs will hear from some old lady that if Commodus killed Marcus then he cannot take the Countship. They suspect that Commodus would kill his father for the position, but cannot prove it. They will tell the PCs that an election will be held if Commodus is found to have killed his father.

In one of the shadier parts of town, a child is gossiping to his friends that he saw Antonio get arrested by Tiberius after handing him something. He can be bribed to reveal more, or just eavesdropped upon.
The kitchens of the Keep have a backdoor in which the PCs can talk to some of the cooks. If they do, then they can learn that Commodus had Head Chef Anton Octavio add something to the meal the night Marcus died. He will even give them an empty vial that used to have the ingredient. The vial is empty.
Dragon’s Feather can confirm that he was paid by Tiberius, Chief of Commodus’ Personal Guard.
The town guard will name Tiberius as the Chief of Commodus’s personal guard.

After the PCs have evidence against Commodus, his personal guard will intervene and try to kill or capture the PCs.
The Guard detail consists of the Guard Captain, Tiberius Septus in Apx B, Spy from the Monster Manual, Lars Homullus, and Tarkanan Assassin from Ebberon, Rising From the Last War, Caeso Bullus.

The day before the ceremony, three factions will arrive in the city. The Mechanicus Liberatus arrives seeking to establish an outpost for garnering support outside Paterdoma. The Mechanicus will buy an abandoned building near the center of town, and spend a week or so building up some of the Mechanical contraptions that are common in Paterdoma. They will not partake in much politics initially.
The Suomalainen are there to buy out failing businesses, and to puppet Commodus around. They will purchase The Seagull’s Nest for a large amount of gold, and sit next to Commodus during the feast. They seek to establish a foothold in Surniam and will bride Commodus for a week continuously.
The Holy Inquisition arrives to establish a Calladonian Church. (This quest is detailed in The Inquisition Arrives) Svetlana Kovasc, the Inquisitor, will begin to root out support for the Sansuvut and begin a propaganda campaign for the Emperor and against the Sansuvut.

In three days time after Marcus’s death, Commodus will be sworn into office. There will be a public ceremony and a feast. At the feast, the PCs will be able to approach him. If they attack, he has a Noble stat block. 
At the feast most of the city will be present, either taking part in the feast, or eating their own food on the sidelines to be part of the celebration. This would be the best chance to confront Commodus.

If Commodus is confronted in front of an audience, then he will attempt to lie to keep his position. If lying fails then he will attempt to either flee(large audience) or arrest/kill everyone present(small audience).
If he is confronted privately, then he will try to kill the PCs and sic the guard on them.
If Commodus is dealt with, then the Head Wizard, Grand Priest, and Master Swordsman will organize an Election to determine a new ruling lineage.

The Ceremony and Feast
NEED TO FILL THIS OUT LATER




Election of Surniam
This election will only happen if Commodus is supplanted. Once Commodus is no longer on the path for the Countship, then the three elders of the city, Master Swordsman of the Combat Ring, Archmage of the Inverted Tower, and Head Priest of the Tundaren Temple, will declare an election for the leader of Surniam. 

Local candidates: 
Jax Elavaren is running for the Countship. He is a well known and liked Surniam. 
Campaign Focus: increasing city pride, and increasing export production. He wants to drawn in more expats and grow Surniam’s population.
Slogan: Build a Bigger Surniam!
Dirt: Jax is hoarding gemstones and keeping scarcity high to keep the prices up. Inside his keep is a storeroom with crates full of gemstones. 


Three factions will seek to elect a person to the Countship:
Suomalainen:
The candidate selected will be Igor Kryzinski. He is a 48 year old Santicap who has lived in Surniam for the last 12 years after he was relocated by the Family heads. He is not very tall, and has a salt and pepper beard. He is missing his left eye, and his arms are covered in smithing scars.
Personality: No-nonsense attitude, gruff
Campaign Focus: Bringing trade from other cities back to Surniam
Slogan: Let’s Show Surniam to the World!
Dirt: He was a hitman for the Suomalainen who was caught by multiple witnesses. He was sent away to avoid arrest, and now serves as a sleeper agent for the family as a blacksmith’s assistant. In his house he keeps his old assassin equipment in a locked chest beneath his bed. 
	In his pocket is a coded note that decodes to “Your exile is over. You are called again to the family to run as Count. You have our full support”.

Mechanicus Liberatus:
The machinicus’s candidate is Aliana Patrera, a former Tech Priest. She left Paterdoma due to wanderlust and married a baker in Surniam. She is tall and pale, with black hair and orange eyes. She is 39 years old, and has lived in Surniam for the last 7 years.
Personality: She is kind and driven. But also a Machanicus fanatic. She will often begin preaching the divinity of the eternal flame, the Bor. 
Campaign Focus: She wants to “modernize” Surnaim by bringing Mechanicus technology to the city. 
Slogan: Fear the Cold No Longer
Dirt: Aliana left Paterdoma for being too extreme, she has calmed down in her age. She has ranted about the idiocy of the Calladonians and Children of Leluka to her husband and close friends. She has a diary of her day to day thoughts, unfiltered. In it there is quite a bit of religious intolerance.

Calladonians and the Inquisition:
The Inquisitor’s candidate is Atticus Manus. A priest of the God Emperor. Since there is no Calladonian Church in Surniam, he has been giving sermons from his house. The small following of Calladonians will go to bat for him. He was born in Surniam, and returned there after an adventure to see the nation, wherein he was converted to the Calladonian faith.
He is tall and thin, with brown hair and a large nose.
Personality: He is kind and open, willing to share his faith with all those willing to listen. He is patient but persistent.
Campaign Focus: He seeks to spread the faith of the God Emperor, and to draw Calladonians to the city.
Slogan: This is the way of the Righteous!
Dirt: He is not the most driven politician, and the Inquisition will puppet him. In his waste bin, he has letters from the Inquisition that instruct him to run for Count, and what to say and do.

Player influence:
Players can be hired by each faction or Jax to expose dirt on the candidates. The PCs can also attempt to boost a candidate’s status through propaganda and advertising. They will not be given much direction on advertising, and progress will be judged by some CHA checks and RP.

Finding dirt on a candidate will send them to the bottom of the rankings
Running a propaganda and ads can boost the candidate’s rank by 1 or more depending on the level of success

Election Results:
Unaided, the Suomalainen will win. The current rankings are:
Igor (Suomalainen)
Jax (Native)
Atticus (Inquisition)
Aliana (Mechanicus)

The Inquisition Arrives
The day before Commodus would be sworn into Countship, an Inquisitor Primus named Svetlana Kovasc arrives in the city. Her main goal is to make sure that Commodus establishes a Calladonian Church, and drives the Sansuvut from the peninsula.
She will be introduced to the PCs in front of the Temple of Tundaren arguing with the Head Priest. She may recognize PCs with connections to the Inquisition or former residents of the Capitol.
If Commodus is not contested or supplanted, he will tell Svetlana that the PCs are heretics who seek to undermine the rule of law. She will come after the PCs with a vengeance.
After Commodus is sworn in, Svetlana will begin to antagonize the Sansuvut, and eventually attempt to drive them out of the city. 
If Commodus is supplanted, and a Calladonian is elected, she will leave peacefully.
If a Calladonian is not elected, then she will seek out those who uncovered Commodus and enact vengeance. 

Hideout of a Master Thief
Within Surniam, a rumor circulates that the Master Thief Miles Dixon is a Saniam. 
He frequents Antonio’s pawn shop, and is in town to comfort Marcella after Antonio’s execution. He wears a large wide-brim hat, with an enormous golden feather. 

In the ledger of Antonio Cerelus, a name that takes up 40% of the transaction, either in buying or selling is Dragon’s Feather. 
In the coming days a man with a very large feather in his hat will come to comfort Marcellia in her grieving. If the PCs approach with hostile intent he will cast invisibility and escape. 
He spends a lot of time with the Sansuvut, and tends to travel in their caravans. 
Commodus’ Escape
Once the PCs return to Surniam, If Igor did not win the election, the keep will have a hole blown out the side of it. Asking around, the PCs will learn a War Wagon came to town, blew a hole into the keep, and sprung Commodus and Chief Tiberius from prison. The Count will have their leg in a cast, and have significant burns on their legs. The War Wagon then left the city and traveled south.
If Igor did win the election, then Commodus will have been pardoned, and he fled the city. None of the following will apply in this case.

Bounty: Commodus Arelius: 500 gp Dead. 1500gp Alive.
He has fled to Atlatipoca and lives with the Suomalainen.
Missing Sansuvut
Surniam has not received the regular tribes traveling from the north. The absence has started to worry many of the traders who rely on the ability to export their goods through the caravans.
