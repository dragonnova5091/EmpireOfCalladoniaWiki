====== Kala Bulb======

The kala bulb is commonly referred to as the most important plant in the culinary world. It's sharp taste and bitter smell, contribute to most dishes cooked in Serberistan. 

The bulb grows in Vernal Ponds and Marshes in the Karataken Hills. Each year the bulb sends out a long shoot from the bottom of the pools, before growing wide leaves and a single large flower. Occasionally used ornamentally, the Kala Bulb is used for its stalk. Growing up to 15 feet long, and up to an inch thick, a single stalk can last a family weeks before needing to buy another. 

Besides the pungent flavor, the Kala Bulb Stalk is filled with a mucus that is used as a thickening agent for competent cooks. Due to the pungent flavor of the stalks, the mucus must be extracted while damaging as little of the stalk as possible to prevent the flavorless mucus from getting infused with the sharp and pungent flavors of the stalk. 

The flowers of the Kala Bulb are occasionally used, however they still retain the distinct flavor of the rest of the plant and many cooks prefer to use other flower petals instead.
