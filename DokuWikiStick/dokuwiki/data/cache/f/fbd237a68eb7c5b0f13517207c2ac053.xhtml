The Sansuvut people are the nomads who roam the land with their sled dogs and herds of <a href="/doku.php?id=bestiary_of_serberistan" class="wikilink2" title="bestiary_of_serberistan" rel="nofollow" data-wiki-id="bestiary_of_serberistan">Ragged Horn Reindeer</a>. They are the oldest people, and have many traditions that are practiced only by them. The Sansuvut are often called the Children of <a href="/doku.php?id=the_lament_of_leluka" class="wikilink1" title="the_lament_of_leluka" data-wiki-id="the_lament_of_leluka">Leluka</a>, a demigoddess who is said to be the grandmother to all. The Children of Leluka is the oldest religion in Serberistan. Until recently the Sansuvut were treated with respect as the elders of the wild. Many hermits are referred to as Sansuvut due to their disassociation with the cities.
