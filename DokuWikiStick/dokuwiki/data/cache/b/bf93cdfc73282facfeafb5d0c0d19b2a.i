So, from her mind she created animals. Great big animals, teeny tiny animals, and all sizes in between. The animals too fell through the empty space. There was no food to eat so they grew hungry, and there was nothing to warm them, so they grew cold. One by one the animals died, until only Aska was left. Aska began to cry, for her children had died. She cried and cried, tears streamed down her face until she cried herself to sleep. In her sleep, the tears streamed from her face and fell far below.

Aska was happy. Aska watched her world. She watched as the animals wandered the plains. She watched as they explored the forests. She watched as they climbed the mountains. She watched as they swam in the oceans. As she watched her smile slowly faded. Though she was happy with her new children, she was sad that none of them could create the way she could. From the clay beneath the trees, Aska formed a new animal. He was not small, nor was he big. He stood on two legs and had two arms with hands that could hold. On his body there was no fur, but the sun kept him warm. Aska took her flame from her chest and cupped a small piece of it in her hands. In his heart, Aska placed this spark. Finally, Aska breathed life into this new creature. This new creature looked up to Aska and asked who he was. Aska spoke to him, “You are Sebestan. You have been created with a divine spark to create in this world of yours.”Sebestan nodded. He set out into the world. From the forests he took trees and made a bow. From the plains he took seeds and made food. From the mountains he took stones and made a hammer. From the ocean he took shells and made a cup. Sebestan walked across the plains and met a herd of animals. They were large, and covered in dark brown fur. On their heads was a pair of ragged horns. He looked upon the herd and declared them to be Ragged Horn Reindeer. Aska called down to Sebestan, “I have named the creatures of the world. You do not need to give them names of your own. These animals are called the Atnar.” But Sebestan did not like this new name, so he refused to learn it. Sebestan took his bow and slew  a large Ragged Horn from the edge of the herd. Sebestan skinned the large animal and created a Chuval with its hide. He sat inside by himself. Sebestan grew lonely. He called out to Aska to save him from his loneliness. Aska looked upon him with compassion. From the clay beneath the trees Aska created another creature. She was slightly smaller than Sebestan, Her face was smooth and hairless, and her bosom was swollen. Sebestan was overjoyed, and asked what to call her. Aska spoke, “Her name shall be Leluka. She is your wife and equal. She will grant you the family you desire.” Content, Sebestan set about showing Leluka the world and all that is in it.

In the north the Vrakken huddled together on the ice to stay warm. On the slopes of the Tundaren Mountains, the Angra clawed into their dens together and warmed each other. On the plains, the Ragged-Horn packed themselves tightly together, and weathered the storm. Under the Karataken Hills, the Solvya snuggled in their burrows, and slept through the storm. In the Aliana Forest, the wild Volki dug dens beneath the snow banks and slept together through the storm. Even the Medved, who live deep in the forest, where the trees block out the sun, and evil things live, they stayed warm in their holes, families kept close. As the snow grew deeper and the wind colder, Leluka’s new family stayed warm, their newfound love warming their hearts.

Once they were old enough, the children set out on the world, as six families. Spreading across the world, the first of the Sanir.
