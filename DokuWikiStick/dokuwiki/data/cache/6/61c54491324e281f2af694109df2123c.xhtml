Saalati is a large leafed plant found across Serberistan. It has a fairly neutral, earthy taste, with the leaves being a little bit more bitter than the stalks. Originally picked wild by early nomads, Saalati has become a common crop for most farmers due to the ease of growing. 
The plant grows quickly in the spring and early summer, sprouting just after the last frost. The plant grows rapidly before bolting and going to seed midsummer. Often times Saalati will sprout a second time on open soil in the summer, going to seed once more before the first frost. It&#039;s seeds much like other plants, are hardy and survive under the snow very well.
