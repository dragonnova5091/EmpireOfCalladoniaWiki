The city boasts a meager few points of interest. The primary being the Grand Jax Mines, The Jalandalus Peninsula, and its various academies and training centers.
The city has an old style of architecture. Most of the houses are built from stone with wooden or thatch roofing. Some of the bigger structures are made with wooden siding, as trees are expensive and dangerous  to import from further up the mountains. The city itself is built along the top of the cliffs of the fjord. To which the cliffs had been fortified many years ago. A mid height fence has been put up along the cliff to prevent accidental falls. 
The climate of Surniam is generally wet. While it does get cold in the winter, the sea air keeps snow from sticking around. The city has developed a complicated system of gutters to flush rainwater from the streets to the ocean. Due to the cold and omnipresent rain, sealskin is used in most clothes for its warmth and water resistance. 
The Saniam are generally kind, although they can be wary of outsiders. Despite the generally wary attitudes, Surniam is an enjoyable place to live as an expat. In the third age, Surniam was home to the largest gemstone mines in Serberistan. Due to a high amount of trade exports, Surniam quickly grew to the wealthiest city in Serberistan. However, the mines have dried up, and many houses remain empty. This extra space allowed Saniam to take control of the infrastructure that was in place and increase the standard of living to far above what many of the other cities can enjoy. Despite having very few draws, Surniam continues to grow in population over the years. 
The nobility of Surniam is generally well liked by the population, Count Marcus Aronteous has ruled the city for the last 45 years. He is well liked and handles most judicial issues himself. The people see him as a kind and just ruler. However, he is growing quite old, and his son, Commodus, is eyeing the title. While Count Marcus has ruled Surniam without the interference of outside factions, as he ages the factions are looking to gain influence over another city. Commodus has been rumored to have ties to the Suomalainen and Mechanicus. If Marcus were to die, then  it is likely that, with the support of the Suomalainen and Mechanicus, Commodus would come to rule Surniam.

One of the PCs has been tipped off that a rare and very potent poison has been shipped to Surnaim to an unknown buyer.

The Suomalainen and Mechanicus Liberatus are supporting Commodus financially with the poison and with support in the coming succession debacle.
Surniam law states that a child cannot inherit status or wealth from a parent if they murdered said parent.
The Suomalainen and Mechanicus will gain 4 faction points each if Commodus is elected.
========= Clues to this plot
When the PCs return to Surniam, a man is executed with a gag over his mouth. He is beheaded in the town square for stealing from Commodus. After his execution, he is tossed over the cliff to the sea below. He is Antonio Cereluis, a blackmarket fence, and the one who picked up the poison from the seller, and delivered it to Commodus. Speak with dead could get Antonio to confess that Commodus had him killed to cover his tracks.
In the pawn shop of Antonio Cerelus, The Seagull’s Nest, a ledger exists in which Antonio recorded every transaction he made and how much each was. Each transaction was listed under a pseudonym for the seller. He listed many pickup spots, where he would pick up items from the unknown sellers. 
Antonio’s wife Marcellia will give the Investigators of Antonio’s death the Ledger.
The ledger contains a transaction from an unknown seller who goes by Dragon’s Feather, and was fenced to Count the Sun. (The hunt for Dragon’s Feather is in Hideout of a Master Thief)

The day before Commodus would be sworn into Countship, an Inquisitor Primus named Svetlana Kovasc arrives in the city. Her main goal is to make sure that Commodus establishes a Calladonian Church, and drives the Sansuvut from the peninsula.
She will be introduced to the PCs in front of the Temple of Tundaren arguing with the Head Priest. She may recognize PCs with connections to the Inquisition or former residents of the Capitol.
If Commodus is not contested or supplanted, he will tell Svetlana that the PCs are heretics who seek to undermine the rule of law. She will come after the PCs with a vengeance.
After Commodus is sworn in, Svetlana will begin to antagonize the Sansuvut, and eventually attempt to drive them out of the city. 
If Commodus is supplanted, and a Calladonian is elected, she will leave peacefully.
If a Calladonian is not elected, then she will seek out those who uncovered Commodus and enact vengeance. ";}i:2;i:21231;}i:117;a:3:{i:0;s:7:"p_close";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:22187;}i:118;a:3:{i:0;s:6:"p_open";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:22187;}i:119;a:3:{i:0;s:5:"cdata";i:1;a:1:{i:0;s:274:"Hideout of a Master Thief

Commodus’ Escape
Once the PCs return to Surniam, If Igor did not win the election, the keep will have a hole blown out the side of it. Asking around, the PCs will learn a War Wagon came to town, blew a hole into the keep, and sprung Commodus and Chief Tiberius from prison. The Count will have their leg in a cast, and have significant burns on their legs. The War Wagon then left the city and traveled south.
