The Sansuvut people are the nomads who roam the land with their sled dogs and herds of <a href="/doku.php?id=cities:bestiary_of_serberistan" class="wikilink2" title="cities:bestiary_of_serberistan" rel="nofollow" data-wiki-id="cities:bestiary_of_serberistan">Ragged Horn Reindeer</a>. They are the oldest people, and have many traditions that are practiced only by them. The Sansuvut are often called the Children of <a href="/doku.php?id=cities:the_lament_of_leluka" class="wikilink2" title="cities:the_lament_of_leluka" rel="nofollow" data-wiki-id="cities:the_lament_of_leluka">Leluka</a>, a demigoddess who is said to be the grandmother to all. The Children of Leluka is the oldest religion in Serberistan. Until recently the Sansuvut were treated with respect as the elders of the wild. Many hermits are referred to as Sansuvut due to their disassociation with the cities.

<h4 id="history">History</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
In the first age, the Sansuvut were the only Sanir. They traveled the land, stopping to pray at the Monoliths before continuing on. Their culture developed slowly, and over many years they discovered new foods and spices, they learned how to create earthenware pottery, and improved on their dogsleds to make them faster and lighter, and much more.
<br/>
The tribes grew over time and as they children grew old, many of them split to make their own tribes. By the end of the first age, many tribes travelled across the world.
